The Titanic survival prediction model project using a Random Forest classifier is a machine learning project that aims to predict which passengers on the Titanic were more likely to survive the shipwreck. The project typically involves the use of a dataset that contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including their demographic information (such as age, gender, and class) and whether or not they survived the disaster.

The dataset is used to train a machine learning model, in this case Random Forest classifier, which is a type of ensemble method that uses a collection of decision trees to make predictions. The decision trees in a Random Forest are constructed using a technique called bootstrap aggregating, or "bagging," which involves randomly selecting subsets of the data to train each tree.

The model is then trained on the dataset by using the training data to learn the relationship between the input features and the output labels (i.e., survival). Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data (i.e., passengers for whom we do not know the survival outcome).

One of the key advantage of Random forest algorithm is, it can handle categorical as well as numerical data and also its robust to overfitting as well.
